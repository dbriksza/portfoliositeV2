        Hello! My name is Daniel Killian Briksza and I'm a Web Developer. What
        does that mean? Well, I'm kind of a nerd who loves problem solving with
        a penchant for the little details. I love math and art, but I wouldn't
        call myself an expert in either, though they are a great help in my line
        of work. My other interests include gardening, tinkering with
        electronics, and video games (started out making games, but I haven't
        kept up my Google Play Store accounts). I get the same joy from working
        with my hands or from slapping some code on the keyboard. I'm very
        personable and always down for a chat, check out my contact info to
        reach out!
      </p>
